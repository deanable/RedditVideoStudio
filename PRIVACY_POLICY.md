# Privacy Policy for RedditVideoStudio

**Last Updated: July 7, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how RedditVideoStudio ("the App") handles your information. Your privacy is important to us.

## 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

RedditVideoStudio is a desktop application that processes data locally on your machine and interacts with third-party APIs on your behalf.

- **Configuration Settings:** The App stores your settings, including API keys for services like Pexels and various Text-to-Speech providers, locally on your computer using the Windows Registry. This information is not transmitted to us.
- **Authentication Tokens:** When you connect your social media accounts (e.g., YouTube, TikTok), the App receives and stores OAuth 2.0 authentication tokens. These tokens are stored securely on your local machine, often using the platform's recommended storage methods (e.g., Google's `FileDataStore` for YouTube). These tokens are used solely to upload videos and manage content on your behalf as instructed by you within the App.
- **Reddit Content:** The App fetches public data from Reddit, such as post titles, text, and comments, based on the subreddit you configure. This data is processed locally to create video content.
- **Usage Data and Logs:** The App generates local log files for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. These logs may contain information about application performance and errors but are not automatically transmitted to us.

## 2. Data Storage and Security

All sensitive information, such as API keys and authentication tokens, is stored locally on your computer's storage. We do not have a central server that collects or stores your personal data. You are responsible for maintaining the security of the computer on which the App is installed.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App interacts with the following third-party services. We recommend you review their privacy policies:

- Reddit

## 4. Your Control

You have full control over your data. You can revoke the App's access to your social media accounts at any time through the respective platform's security settings. [cite_start]You can also clear all locally stored authentication data by using the "Disconnect" or "Sign Out" features within the App[cite: 1793].
